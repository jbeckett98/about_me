My name is Jax, im a very laid back, go-with-the-flow kinda guy, but im also very spiritual and intellectual if you know my mind. You will rarely see me without headphones because music is my favourite thing in the world. My interest include music, food, video games, photography, spending time with the people I love and overall just having a good time, within whatever I may be doing. I had a pretty crappy expierience with programming in hishschool, doing C++, but im interested in this course so far. Oh, and im always tired.
